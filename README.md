# Task-03: Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction

## Introduction
This project focuses on building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used is related to a bank's marketing campaign, containing features such as age, job, marital status, education, housing loan status, personal loan status, etc., with the target variable being whether the individual subscribed to a term deposit or not.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Seaborn and Matplotlib: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of demographic and behavioral features, with the target variable indicating subscription to a term deposit.

## Data Visualization
Visualizations include distributions of age, occupation, marital status, education, housing loan status, personal loan status, and outcome (deposit or not). A correlation matrix heatmap is used to visualize relationships between numerical variables.

## Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing steps involve label encoding categorical variables, train-test split, and standardization of numerical features.

## Model Training and Evaluation
A decision tree classifier is trained and evaluated using accuracy score, cross-validation score, and classification report. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using grid search cross-validation.

## Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix heatmap is used to evaluate the performance of the decision tree classifier model.

## Decision Tree Visualization
A visual representation of the decision tree classifier model is generated.

## Conclusion
Insights drawn from the analysis and model evaluation aid in understanding customer purchase behavior and can inform marketing strategies and decision-making processes.
